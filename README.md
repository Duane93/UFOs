# UFOs
Deliverable 2

Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to build a site where people who visit it can filter and add their sightings through the data in order to look up information on sightings of UFOs.

Results
In order to use the new webpage you simply would have to know what you’d like to search for. By inputting the “state, “country” or whatever search criteria on the filter list, you then can search up appearances of UFO sightings.

Summary
One drawback of this new design is that it can be flooded with inquiries from “trolls”. In order to limit the amount of trolls, I would suggest a login system which would require email verification to limit the amount of fake inquiries. I would also suggest a tab where people can input pictures. Pictures would help out the page greatly because people can see what they’re talking about instead of commenting about it.
